Building and styling a responsive product component

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Getting hands on practice using HTML and CSS on my own.
working with box-shadow and understanding its use, vertical, horizontal, blur, and color.

swapping images on a different screen width with:
content: url("image.jpg");

### Continued development

Once I learn react I would do this (probably on a smilar challenge) and make it responsive for a range of different sizes not just 1440px and 375px
